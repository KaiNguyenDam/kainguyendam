### Hi there 👋

I'm Kai Nguyen Dam, a college student at DePauw University originally from Vietnam with a keen interest in data analytics and statistical analytics. As someone who is passionate about data-driven decision making, I'm constantly honing my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and statistical modeling. On my GitHub, you'll find projects that demonstrate my proficiency in tools such as [Programming Languages (e.g., Python, R)], [Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., ggplot, Seaborn)], and [Statistical Analysis Tools (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, SQL)]. These projects showcase my ability to analyze and interpret data to drive insights and inform business decisions. 


Outside of work, I enjoy:
- ⚽️ Watching and playing soccer
- 🍜 Cooking, especially Asian food
- 🎧 Listening to music
- ✈️ Travelling


I'm actively seeking internships in the field of data analytics or business analytics to gain practical experience and apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I'm enthusiastic about leveraging data to solve complex problems and optimize business processes. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out to me for potential internship opportunities. Let's collaborate and uncover valuable insights from data to drive strategic decision making!
